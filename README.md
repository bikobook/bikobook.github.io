            This will be <strong>a <em>great</em> location </strong>for you <strong>to simply relax</strong> and shmax. Note: Shmax is a made up word for relax. The ocean will be <em>just</em> the right temperature to swim in, with <strong>no known reportings of sharks or any dangerous animals.</strong> It will be a fun place to scuba dive as well, with many colorful fish <em>you could only see</em> in your dreams, books, or on the internet. There is also <strong>no jellyfish that would sting you</strong>, and colorful reefs. It would also be nice to sail in, surf in, or just relax on the beach. It <em>hardly rains here</em>, so there is little chance of a rainy day to spoil your plans. By the way, I have no idea where this place is. Sorry, but thanks for reading!

        <h2>Info on Beach Hotel</h2>
        
        <p>
            
           <em>Whenever</em> you need to have a place to stay here, <strong>the beach hotel would be a nice place to stay in.</strong> It is a <strong>very cheap place to stay in</strong>, charging <strong>only $500 a day</strong>. <strong>At breakfast, lunch, and dinner you will be served <em>nutritious and delicous food</em></strong>. You will even have three choices for every meal and <strong>gluten-free dessert</strong> after. There will even be an outdoor and indoor <strong>swimming pool.</strong>

           <ul>
           
           <li>
           
           In <strong>each small sized hotel room there will be </strong>two <em>king beds</em>, one TV, a kitchen, a bathroom, two couches, and extra accesories. 
           
           </li>
           
           <li>
           
           A <strong>medium sized hotel room</strong> would have the same things except one more <strong>king sized bed</strong>, one more bathroom, a recliner, and one more TV. It will also be larger. 
           
           </li>
           
           <li>
           
           The <strong>biggest hotel room</strong> will have the same as a medium room except one more<strong> queen sized bed,</strong> another TV, and will be large. </li>
            
           </ul>
           
           <p>
           
           Note: Every bedroom will have a closet, and the size will depend on which hotel size you chose. The <em>only problem</em> is that I haven't the slightest idea where this place may be. I don't even <em>know</em> if it exists.
